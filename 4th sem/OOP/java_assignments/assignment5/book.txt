Computer science is challenging, and yet dynamic. It requires people in the field to be 
keep learning and pushing the limit. That fast-pacing innovation of technology never stops 
amazing me, which excites my innate curiosity even more. I, however, had never thought 
about pursuing computer science as a career until I took an introductory class in my junior
 year. It sparked my interest and changed my thoughts after seeing what I could do with 
some simple line of codes. Despite of many countless times sitting in front of the computer
 screen trying out figure how to do solve a problem, those "Aha" moments were more precious
 and exciting for me. For every minute like that, I was exhilarating and smiled as if I 
have just won an Olympics' gold medal in a 100-meter racing swim lap. It fed my hunger for 
exploration to see what else I could do, may be something beyond my imagination. Computer 
science gradually became my hobby in my senior year. I searched many online resources to 
finally find Codeacademy and later Udacity. I first learned about HTML and CSS on 
CodeAcademy to make some simple websites, but I was not satisfied with it.

 Meanwhile, I found out about Udacity, offered a well-written and easy-to-follow 
introductory course in Python to make my own Google search. These experiences slowly pull 
me into the course of a new career, computer science. Pursuing a degree in this field can 
provide me knowledge and skills and along with my passion to bring changes to 
people's daily lives starting from mobile application. I want to be a part of this 
evolution of technology.
